# timer-game

# TODO
- Clicking on a timer causes a render which still interferes with the interval?
- Sometimes two timers spawn at once
- More visual feedback on click or hover perhaps
- Fix finnicky number input with "step=0.1" not being able to type "."

- Implement game end options:
	- Fix scoring to be more meaningful
	- Implement "infinite mode", where when you click a timer, after interval, a new timer gets spawned
	- Add several end game options:
		- When all timers have been clicked, show score screen
		- When max time has been reached, show score screen
		- When a certain number of timers have been clicked in infinite mode, show score screen
